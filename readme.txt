Array Statistics Calculator:

This C++ program was written as part of my learning journey to understand the basics of C++ programming. The program calculates and displays various statistics (sum, maximum, minimum) for a set of 10 numbers input by the user.

Program Overview:

- Prompts the user to input 10 numbers
- Stores the numbers in an array
- Calculates the sum, maximum, and minimum of the numbers
- Displays the input numbers, sum, maximum, and minimum

Features:

- User input for numbers
- Array data structure for storing numbers
- Looping structures using for loops
- Conditional statements for finding maximum and minimum
- Clear and informative output

How to Run the Program:

1. Copy the provided C++ code into a .cpp file
2. Compile the program using a C++ compiler
3. Run the compiled program:
    - On Linux/macOS: ./array_statistics
    - On Windows: array_statistics.exe
4. Enter 10 numbers when prompted

Learning Objectives:

- Understanding basic user input and output
- Using arrays for data storage
- Implementing looping structures (for loops)
- Working with integer variables and arithmetic operators
- Finding maximum and minimum values in an array
